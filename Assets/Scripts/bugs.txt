[urgent]
un-aggroed enemies do not aggro in first shrine

# "Okay I definitely did not beat the second to last shrine but the game thinks I did. At some point after losing and quickly reentering, the fight started but then fight window disappeared and I could still hear fight music for a second, and then I heard the complete sound and now it seems I have won the fight"

"-when starting a trial there are already sometimes shots fired when you start so it makes you have to instantly dodge shoot and pray.(difficult but not impossible, definitely something that could be easily kept based on your desire of difficulty)
-when restarting the game after pressing [esc] it restarts the runes again, but the mc still has some items"

# spamming f while dying while cause what is, functionally speaking, a freeze

[design]
logmenu looks unfinished and confusing to players when there's no runes in it
the invisible walls are stupid
barman had no trouble beating all the shrines without any runes
add a sound effect when player loses a life
there is a conflict between [space] and [f]. they are both the "do-something" button. sometimes it is unclear if a thing is [f]-thing or [space]-thing
# add a "wind-up" to the start of the shrine combat
the card puzzle in the church makes no sense, is easy to brute force
# players want items to persist
