[urgent]
un-aggroed enemies do not aggro in first shrine
arena colliders trap player
# remenu preserves satchel items, not cards or runes
# remenu and reenter causes shrines to half-start, with the disc spawning but no ornaments or enemies
eventually a half-started shrine will register itself as complete and give u the "complete" message
# entering dungeon-zoom, quitting, then restarting will preserve dungeon-zoom and fuck the camera
sentinels can "spawn" right on top of the player (what did barman mean by spawn? aggro?)
# [esc][space] causes a crash


[design]
logmenu looks unfinished and confusing to players when there's no runes in it
the invisible walls are stupid
barman had no trouble beating all the shrines without any runes
add a sound effect when player loses a life
there is a conflict between [space] and [f]. they are both the "do-something" button. sometimes it is unclear if a thing is [f]-thing or [space]-thing
add a "wind-up" to the start of the shrine combat
the card puzzle in the church makes no sense, is easy to brute force
